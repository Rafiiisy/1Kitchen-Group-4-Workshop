<details>
   <summary><b>Ghost Kitchen</b></summary>
   <p>Ghost kitchens or dark kitchens are professional kitchens designed specifically for food delivery services. These delivery kitchens are strategically located in areas where there is a high demand for delivery. They do not have a physical store, and their menus are only available for delivery. These virtual restaurants work like digital storefronts, with a small number of staff members working in the back to fulfill online orders. Because they are digital, they have the potential to reach more customers than traditional physical locations.</p>

# Mission

We are trying to shine a light on the new restaurant concept business called "Ghost Kitchen". It is hardly seen in Indonesia and we want to spread this amazing concept to the people.

# Logo

One Kitchen. The logo merges "1" and "K" to represent our brand. Our initials (1K) represents that all restaurants can have one kitchen, one place. We chose the colour green since it's a popular colour used for food delivery apps since it is associated with wellness.
